# Asylum Tutorials

This project provides supplementary material for my (hungarian) articles posted on my [blog](http://darthasylum.blog.hu/).
The old version is archived [here](https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZ4QhG7ZuA3jBe49U35VRBo2shrAaup27xS7), I won't touch it anymore.

## Compilation

You need *Visual Studio 2015* or newer to compile the samples (64-bit only). All external libraries are included (except the *Vulkan* validation layers).
For the *Metal* samples you need *macOS 10.14* with *XCode 10* or later and an *Apple* account for code signing.
